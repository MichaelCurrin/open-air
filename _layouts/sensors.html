<h3>About</h3>

A summary of sensor data provided by a certain API endpoint.

This was view was built mainly to check that sensors (labelled with IDs) are active in a region. Especially ones which have been turned on for the first time. Further details on sensors are provided as an extra.

While not as visual as a map (which already exists on the original project's site), the view is still a lot easier to scan quickly as a table rather than as the source JSON data.
